The goal of this week is to dive into the topic of security, privacy, and surveillance in order to get oriented to and immersed in this topic.


#### Here is the work for Week 4:

1. ***Introduction to Unit 2*** - Please listen this to brief introduction to Unit 2.

2. ***Readings/Viewings***

Read these three texts:

* Doctorow, [Demon-haunted computers are back, baby](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/18/descartes-delenda-est/#self-destruct-sequence-initiated)
* Keegan, [Each Facebook User is Monitored by Thousands of Companies](https://themarkup.org/privacy/2024/01/17/each-facebook-user-is-monitored-by-thousands-of-companies-study-indicates)
* Pavel, [Rethinking data and rebalancing digital power](https://www.adalovelaceinstitute.org/report/rethinking-data/). Read Chapter 1 (Understanding power in data-intensive digital ecosystems) of this report. You can do so online or by downloading the PDF.

As you do so, please read them from two perspectives:

- ***The technology or technologies being discussed***. What are these technologies? Were they developed for the purposes discussed OR are they applications of other technologies? What are the stated goals of the described usages of these technologies? How well do you think these technologies would meet or fail to meet the stated goals?

- ***The Privacy/Security/Surveillance***. In what ways are data about you and I being used or possible abused? What do our computing systems know about us and how do they know these things? Give some thing, too, to the ethical implications of these uses of tracking/surveillance technologies.

As you are reading these articles, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for Weeks 2 and 3. As I said last week, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts (which you will start doing this week). 

3. ***Interactions***

Now that you have done some reading about privacy/security/surveillance, I would like you to track your own interactions with computing devices this week. Try to keep track of the things (products, videos, locations, etc.) that are recommended to you as you use your computing devices. Then, think about what those devices either actually know about you (like your location) or think they know about you (your tastes, preferences, desires, etc.). Share your findings from this experiment with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 4 channel***. Feel free to include screenshots in your post if you like.

[Here is how you would upload images](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html) to your Mattermost posts.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday, February 12***.
