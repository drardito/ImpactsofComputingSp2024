The goal of this week is to apply the ethical frameworks with which we have been engaging since last week (*virtue ethics*, *utilitarianism*, and *deontology*, and apply them to some current topics concerned with the impacts of computing in our daily lives. These current topics are focused on the use of computing technology to monitoring and surveillance to (theoretically at least) improve areas of human endeavor.


#### Here is the work for Week 3:

1. ***A Story to Get Us Started*** - Please listen to this brief story about mash potatoes and ethics (really) to set the context for this week's work.

2. ***Readings/Viewings***

Read these four articles:

* Doctorow, [I assure you, an AI didn't write a terrible "George Carlin" routine](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/29/pay-no-attention/#to-the-little-man-behind-the-curtain)
* Kaiser-Schatzlein, [How Life as a Trucker Devolved Into a Dystopian Nightmare](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/EReipYUxmUBBinuoDRUbsJkBAF3XCFqmRjjA0Nf6LslTDQ?e=uXwAPU)
* McIntyre & Bradbury, [The eyes of Amazon: a hidden workforce driving a vast surveillance system](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/ESbU26V25e5OnmhMyHZlR_IBTT2OleaTMSK4HJwhP9vutA?e=LGFspm)
* Thompson, [AI Won’t Steal Your Job, But It’ll Sure Make It Suck](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/ERSRMN1B5URNivgRvkiIlAIB9Xj7u1qoV1rBVnMNVw9hMQ?e=9UO4CJ)

As you do so, please read them from two perspectives:

1. ***The technology or technologies being discussed***. What are these technologies? Were they developed for the purposes discussed OR are they applications of other technologies? What are the stated goals of the described usages of these technologies? How well do you think these technologies would meet or fail to meet the stated goals?
2.  ***The Ethical implications for the applications of the technologies being discussed***. How would you assess the ethical implications of the stated usages of these technologies in these scenarios? How would we apply each of our three ethical frameworks to these scenarios? 

As you are reading these articles, please take notes using the document you created as a part of the work for Week 2. As I said last week,  the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts (which you will start doing this week). 

3. ***Interactions***

   Now that you have done the reading and ethical analyses of these three articles, it is time for you to interact with one another. In order to do so, I ask that you ***create a diagram*** that captures the findings of your ethical analysis, and then share it with us on Mattermost in the Week 3 channel, along with ***some commentary*** that highlights the major takeaways from your analysis AND the major questions you are left with from doing this work.
   
   [Here is how you would upload images](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html) to your Mattermost posts.

This work is due by the end of the day on **Monday, February 5 **.
