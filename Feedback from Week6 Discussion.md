I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 6, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you wrestle with collective responsibility.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. Once again, I appreciate the consistent ways in which you are engaging with one another, both in terms of frequency and substance. Keep up the good work!

2. ***Moral Taint and Ethical Distance.*** I really appreciated the range and depth of how you all addressed these topics.

*Moral Taint*. I thought this from @christina_g exemplified what many of your said about *moral taint*.

> When I was reading your response I was intrigued by your points with the computers in World War II if they are posed good or bad. I agree 100 percent with you that it isn't the computers fault that they have aged over time and the people that are breaking codes for these computers to help build the bomb are the ones doing it. The computer is just an object that has evolved enough where it was unfortunately used for a bad thing that went down in history.

Also, thanks to @wallyd who added:
> Are math, physics, computer science, aviation, and penicillin bad because the military funded their development? Of course not. They can all be used for good or evil. (Penicilin can induce seizures, especially in people with epilepsy. It can also cause allergic reactions.) In terms of ethics, these things are all tools, and the actions that people or collectives take using them can be judged as ethical or unethical, but the tools are neither.

 *Ethical Distance*. I appreciate what @nickisrael said here:
> I was immediately interested in the concept of “Ethical distance”. I interpreted it as the correlation between how close individuals are to something they might be blamed for. An individual's moral responsibility typically decreases as ethical distance increases. 

Also, thanks to @seanclohessy for this:
>The biggest takeaway I had with these readings and comparing it to the others is what will you do about something if it’s right in front of you.

*Altrusism.* I thought @gabe really hit home with this:
>  there are some key similarities and differences between the collective responsibilities and altruism. Both set some means of moral standards; however, one is more instinctual (altruism) while the other is more mechanical (collective responsibilities). 

And while @ryandaich wasn't so much talking about altrusim, I really appreciated this:

>Technologies that can be developed for beneficial use, then put to harmful uses for example, surveillance tools meant to support public safety, but used to spy on people who don't pose a threat carry a moral taint. 

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive as represented by the total number of words (over 14,000, as usual) and the number of unique words (almost 2100), and average words per sentence (20.1 which has been very consistent, surprisingly). It is still my plan to look at our Mattermost discussions as a whole. I will likely do this when you start working on your final projects.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as for the past four weeks, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. This week, I am particularly struck by the wide range of the terms used in your discussions, especially: *collective*, *people*, *individuals*, *companies*, and *responsibility*. Oh, and once again, most of your are posting in the afternoons/evenings, as indicated by the frequency of the term *pm*. It would be very interesting to take a deeper dive into the ways in which you are using these terms.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=9ee6ccfbd2e8bb7edc340585b97fd273&query=altruism&query=moral&query=taint&query=article&query=evolve&query=reading&query=responsibility&query=distance&query=people&query=computing&query=world&query=like&query=impacts&query=empathy&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting to me. It is interesting to see the size and depth of the connections between the terms *altruism*, *moral*, and *responsibility*. [This network](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=9ee6ccfbd2e8bb7edc340585b97fd273&view=CollocatesGraph&query=altruism&query=moral&query=taint&query=article&query=evolve&query=computing&query=people&query=impacts&query=society&query=devices&query=ethical&query=distance&query=business&query=responsibility&query=help&query=world&query=technology&query=collective&query=like&query=post&query=facebook&query=pm&query=reading&query=week&query=hi&query=person&query=increase&query=war&query=ii&query=different&query=empathy&query=lack&query=amazon&query=trust&query=reassuring&query=levin&query=unto&mode=corpus&context=9) gets even more extensive when I expand the range of connected words (usually, as above, I use  a range of 7 words, but in this one I used a range of 9). You can get a sense of this increased depth  comparing these two images. The top one shows the connections between words in the Week 6 discussions with a range of 7 words between them. The bottom one shows the connections between words in the Week 6 discussions with a range of 9 words between them.

         I ask that you play with this word network and share what connections and trends you see and what you take away from them. By the way, what do you make of *stephanie* being dead center in this visualization?

Please feel free to share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 6 discussion on Mattermost.
