The goal of this week is to explore the ethics of ***Altruism***, which will complement and extend our discussion about *collective responsibility* from Week 5.

One thing to keep in mind as you read these texts is the origin of value. For example, is the child responsible for and/or tainted by the sins of their parents? As a preview to next week, computers were born out of the need to win World War II in terms of codebreaking and designing the first atomic bombs. Does this mean that computers and computing are inherently bad or evil?


#### Here is the work for Week 6:

1. ***Introduction to Week 6*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 6.

2. ***Readings/Listenings***

Read these two texts:

* Gregory Mellema (2003), [Responsibility, Taint, and Ethical Distance in Business Ethics](https://manhattanville-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/gerald_ardito_mville_edu/ESoghN2gsOlAiMlF8n61nWIBCLCXG3N67z8_nS4uCm_ZlA?e=904qgK).
* Joy of Wh(y) Podcast (2024), [How Did Altruism Evolve?](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-did-altruism-evolve-20240215/)

As you do so, please read/listen to them from (at least) two perspectives:

- ***What (if anything) is different about viewing ethical issues from a collective/networked perspective***? What is the relationship, in your mind, between collective responsibility and altruism? How are they the same? How are they different? What are the ethical implications of altruism?

- ***How does/should the idea of moral taint shape our thinking about the moral and ethical impacts of computing?*** Computers were born out of the need to win World War II in terms of codebreaking and designing the first atomic bombs. Does this mean that computers and computing are inherently bad or evil? 

As you are reading these articles, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 5 Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 5 about ***collective responsibility*** and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday**.
- *Week 6 Discussion*. Now that you have read about *altruism* and *moral taint*, think about how they apply to our discussions thus far and their moral/ethical implications as we think about the impacts of computing.  Share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 6 channel***. Feel free to include screenshots in your post if you like. This is a great week for lots of discussion.

[Here is how you would upload images](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html) to your Mattermost posts.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday, February 26***.
