I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 7, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you wrestle with algorithms and rabbit holes.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. Once again, I appreciate the consistent ways in which you are engaging with one another, both in terms of frequency and substance. Keep up the good work!

2. ***Algorithms*** I really appreciated how you engaged with these texts and how they talked about privacy, algorithms, and algorithmic colonization.

*Algorithmic Colonization*. I thought this from @gabe_pollack started us off really well:

> After reading/ listening to this weeks content, I found myself most interested in the topic of Algorithmic colonization. However, I feel as if I struggle to understand al the nuances within how it actually plays out, and I feel as if some examples given don't really rise to the levels of "oh this is definitely a form of colonialism". 

 *Impact*. Check out what @abramsons said here:
> Just when I thought algorithms and their systems were bad, it somehow becomes even worse. After reading, watching, and listening to this week’s content (coupled with last week’s content) on algorithms, I was stuck by not only the impact of how tech companies use surveillance capitalism to project an ideology of the internet (and the user’s experience of the internet) onto their users, but also by how a user can fall into a “recommended content” rabbit hole based on an algorithm curated to fit a ideology (whether internet or political based).

And this from @eglentina.prozhmi: 

>
>	Algorithms, in contemporary discourse, emerge as pivotal elements shaping the digital landscape, embodying both promise and peril in equal measure. 

*What about those data?* Check about what @correial has to say about data:

> However, the article truly describes the ways in which AI and technology don't even view people as "people," rather they are seen as just objects with data. And where does this data go? I think this article was extremely interesting and showed how technology can be used against us and is not being created for our benefit, but rather for the benefit of creating profitable AI systems. 

And this from @kieratucci:

> I feel that is a common trend when it comes to technology and these hidden aspects of it that not everyone is aware of. Again I always wondered what they could be doing with this data but as our society moves and years go on we learned that the goal is to predict and with that make money. The way that what technology companies are doing is hidden and not being reprimanded either. I feel a lot of that has to do with the fact that being knowledgeable on technology can be difficult for the average person and AI and data collection can be hard to understand.

*Relevance*. Thanks to @andrewdiclerico for this:

> I found this weeks information on algorithms particularly interesting as I can see this in my own life. The collection of data is out of control and is precisely why I do not have any "smart home" products in my house. I think it is a complete invasion of privacy and allowing it in your home is in a way, supporting this privacy invasion.



3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  After two weeks of declining word counts (which is neither good nor bad, as far as I am concerned) the overall word count from your Week 10 posts and replies have increased (13,746 words). Your average words per sentence (20.6) and unique words (2,145) are consistent with those values in former weeks. I remain fascinated that these figures are so consistent. I would love to know what you think about all this. Please respond to this feedback post with any ideas/hypotheses/speculations you might have.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as it always does, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. It is not surprising to see that the key terms in the texts show us in this visualization: *algorithms*, *youtube*, and *people*. [Once again, our old friend *pm* has returned to prominence as well.] What is even more interesting to me is the diversity of the next frequency tier terms, such as: *surveillance*, *interesting*, *companies*, *think*, and *way*. I would love to know what you make of this pattern.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=2d0f2d2b6626b5a1a0c86b364b774f0e&query=people&query=caleb&query=statistics&query=social&query=media&query=data&query=mining&query=article&query=ai&query=privacy&query=algorithms&query=surveillance&query=powerful&query=help&query=capitalism&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting to me. In particular, I am struck by the wider than usual range of highly linked terms. I expected the the links to the most obvious terms, such as: *algorithms*, *surveillance*, and *capitalism*. But I was surprised to see other less expected terms and how they are connected, such as: *privacy*, *people*, *help*, and *powerful*. What patterns do you see? And how do these trends reflect (or not) your experience of these texts this week?
