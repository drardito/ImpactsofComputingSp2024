I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 4, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you express your surprise/dismay at the extent to which you (and all of us) are being tracked. Additionally, I am fascinated to see your responses to this.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. As I said last week, my analyses of your interactions for this week included what you said in your comments/replies to one another. I think that this extension had shed really interesting light on these discussions and your degree of engagement.

2. ***Being Tracked.*** It was so interesting to read your stories (and your surprise and dismay) of seeing evidence of being tracked as you engage with social networks and other web services. I want to share one exemplar posted by @wendym88 : *Before reading this week's material, I was aware of our data being shared but didn't know it was that frequent and high. One of the data collection categories mentioned in one of the articles is "events". As I was keeping track of the things that were recommended to me as I used my cellphone device, I realized this when I visited a Go Karting website about two weeks ago. However, I saw the ad for that same Go-karting place a few days ago on Youtube, which is kinda crazy. Another thing I noticed, is how persistent these algorithms are. For example, I viewed ONCE on TikTok Shop, a hair brush, and ever since I clicked on it, I've been getting those ads frequently on my For You Page. There is no doubt that data is viewed as an economic opportunity and though it enhances the service and experience for users, not everyone is okay with that. The problem is that it requires effort from us the users to go beyond what we should already have ( privacy) to put an end to our data being shared.*

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive as represented by the total number of words (over 14,000) and the number of unique words (about 2100), and average words per sentence (21.2). The features of your writing remain relatively consistent, which is interested in and of itself. Keep up the good work!

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as for the last three weeks, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. This week, I am particularly struck by the wide range of the terms used in your discussions. Given the open nature of the prompt and your responses, this does not surprise me one bit. This visualization shows equal weights/frequencies for the terms: *phone*, *data*, *privacy*, *ads*, *like* (which I do not fully understand), and *know*.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization]([Voyant Tools (voyant-tools.org)](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=837205f431dbb0b28846b81ada17542e&query=pm&query=hi&query=replies&query=post&query=really&query=nice&query=ads&query=like&query=instagram&query=search&query=pop&query=social&query=time&query=tiktok&query=privacy&query=videos&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph)) is very interesting to me. As we saw in the wordcloud, this was a far more expansive discussion and this is reflected in the Links graph as well. This is the most extensive set of connections that we have seen so far. Rather than being a more dense network of terms like we saw this week, this week's networks of terms is far more distributed. What patterns do you see and why do you think they emerged?

Please feel free to share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 4 discussion on Mattermost.
