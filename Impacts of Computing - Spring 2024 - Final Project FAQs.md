Here are some ***FAQs*** to support your work on your final projects.

## What sources can I use?

You should be using credible sources. However, like our readings for the class, some of those are peer-reviewed research (like you would find on Google Scholar), and some are other credible sources (like the articles from Cory Doctorow).

If you have a question about whether a source is credible, I am happy to help you make a determination.

## How can I find research/sources for my project?

There are many ways to find research/sources for your project.

1. **Course Readings/viewings/listenings**. You can certainly use any of the materials that I assigned as part of this course. One *bonus source* is any references or other materials cited in these readings/viewings/listenings.
2. **Philosophy Resources**. The Manhattanville librarians have put together [this set of sources](https://mville.libguides.com/c.php?g=1167119&p=8521929) that are Philosophy focused. These can be helpful if you are working to expand your knowledge of ethical and moral frameworks.
3. **Google Scholar**. [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) allows you to search for research articles that have been published in reputable journals, meaning that are almost always peer-reviewed, the gold standard for published research.
4. **Mville Library Databases**. The Mville library has access to several research databases,which you can access [here](https://mville.libguides.com/libraryhome). Pro tip. You can always also reach out to a reference librarian, which you can do via chat on the [library website](https://mville.libguides.com/libraryhome).

## What format should I use for my reference citations?

For this project, you should use ***APA 7th citation style***.

The Manhattanville librarians have put together a terrific guide for doing so, which you can find [here](https://mville.libguides.com/citation/apa).
