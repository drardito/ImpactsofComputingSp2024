I have just reviewed your discussions with one another on ther readings/viewings/listenings for Week 12, on AI and Health Care. It was really interesting to see what those of you who are nursing students had to say on this topic, as well as the rest of you who are (along with families and friends) consumers of health care.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. My impression is that this discussion (and maybe more than many) provoked very personal reactions which were demonstrated in your posts and replies to one another. More below.

2. ***Impacts of AI on Health Care***. I was struck by many aspects of your discussions. Here are some trends I wanted to point out.

*Let the Nursing Students Speak*. I thought we would start by hearing from our Nursing Students, Amanda, Emily, and Kierra:

from @mottoshiske:

> It (AI) helps with medication management, dietary advice, and clinical judgment and advice. There are also AI-based surgical robots that provide surgeons with advanced instruments, translate the surgeon’s hand movement at the console in real-time, and deliver highly magnified, 3D high-definition views of the surgical area. This helps improve the efficiency of the best surgeons. Overall, this helps to predict health trajectories, recommend treatments, and automate administrative tasks. "Clinical AI tools have shown promise in predicting health trajectories of patients, recommending treatments, guiding surgical care, monitoring patients, and supporting population health management." As well as, "Administrative AI tools have shown promise in reducing provider burden and increasing efficiency by recording digital notes, optimizing operational processes, and automating laborious tasks." Like other AI technologies, there are challenges surrounding the tools including, data access, bias, scaling and integration, lack of transparency, privacy, and uncertainty over liability. However, there are policies that are being implemented to help manage and address these issues. 

From @kieratucci:

> We know that Apple Watch had to recall one version because the AI health tracking was not 100% accurate and if people are relying on that it can cost them their lives. I remember hearing a story or someone who used their Apple Watch to monitor their blood sugar because they were a diabetic and one day it didn’t work and that person ended up dying because of that. While this is scary you do have to take into consideration that maybe fully relying on the Apple Watch isn’t the best idea and there may be risks to that. I know another story that a friend told me of someone they knew was in the hospital and they were short staffed nurses so they had a virtual nurse and that was acceptable. I think when it comes to nursing that is not acceptable because being a nurse is hands on care for a patient and building a report with them knowing that you are there to help them when they need it. So, using those tools to be a virtual nurse I feel is wrong and I don’t think those patients are getting the same level of care which is wrong. There are good and bad stories when it comes to AI in healthcare so I am not sure where you draw the line or when to continue forward with it because as I said it can be beneficial and also not beneficial.

And this from @amandabene:

> Many hospitals already employ robots for delivering supplies, among other activities, but they have limitations. For example, many of the currently deployed supply delivery robots do not have an arm and therefore still require a human for tasks such as opening doors and picking up items.” Now I propose a situation- a 90 year old bed bound patient named Mr. Johnson had an accident in his bed, the unit is under staffed. I'm the nurse, I'm assigned to 6 other patients, and I'm going to wait for the robot to get here with supplies to clean him up and change him. While waiting for the robot, I answer a different patient's call bell. Suddenly, I've gotten so busy with my 6 other patients that I didn't realize that the robot never came with the supplies- it's been an hour. Now I have to go searching for the robot, taking valuable time away from my patients, to discover it got stuck trying to leave the supply room. Now, poor Mr. Johnson is at risk for skin breakdown and infection as a result of sitting in his soiled linens. 

*The Rest of Us*. And here are some intriguing posts from the rest of us, where there was much relief about reports of positive uses of AI in Healthcare:

From @mtarby:

> I am typically looking to see where we can use things instead of cannot, and was very excited to read about some medical uses for AI. Of course it does still have problems, many of which remained the same as last week's (such as difficulty when the data differs from the data it was trained on), but there was overall a much more positive outlook. 

More, from @gabe:

> Unlike our past weeks’ discussion, I feel that the utilization of A.I. in this particular field is much more effective and beneficial for society.



Thanks to @abramsons for this take:

> I personally think that AI such as Nuance, Sensely, and VoxelMorph (as well as other AI technologies like that) can be extremely revolutionizing in the world of healthcare, diagnosing diseases at an early stage, recommending treatments for those diseases, and automating administrative tasks for healthcare workers.

@wallyd will have the last word(s):

>After several weeks of videos and readings that were mostly depressing or alarming, we had a week that wasn’t half-bad. (Thank you.) “MD vs. Machine: Artificial intelligence in health care” consisted of three talks and a panel. Although the first talk was about “AI”, the best example was the use of data science to UNDERSTAND the data through visualization and possibly classification, the use of traditional search (which is AI but not necessarily deep learning) to do research, and
>the use of human intelligence to solve the problem.



3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  The amount of writing the your Week 12 posts and replies is down a bit from the previous two weeks. The overall word count from your Week 12 posts and replies (12, 684 words) is about 1000 words lower than the previous weeks, and your unique words (1942) was also down. I am not sure to what to attribute this. That being said, our average words per sentence (21.3) and remain consistent with those values in former weeks.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as it always does, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. It is not surprising to see that the key terms in the texts show us in this visualization: *algorithms*, *youtube*, and *people*. [Once again, our old friend *pm* has returned to prominence as well.] What is even more interesting to me is the diversity of the next frequency tier terms, such as: *surveillance*, *interesting*, *companies*, *think*, and *way*. I would love to know what you make of this pattern.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=96e8d3a5129a3b94c6b607a583685e89&query=ai&query=tools&query=healthcare&query=used&query=use&query=field&query=industry&query=patients&query=help&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting. As we saw in Week 11 (and  with no surprise given the readings/viewings/listenings), there a set of very strong connections to a predictable set of terms: *healthcare*, *ai*, and *tools*. More importantly, I think, was the words to which these terms to connected, such as *medical*, *health*, and *field*. I am curious what connections you noticed.
