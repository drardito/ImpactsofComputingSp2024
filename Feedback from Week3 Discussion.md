I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 3, which took me longer than usual, for which I apologize. That being said, having been living in your interactions for the past day or two has been really fascinating. The biggest change was also including your replies to one another in the various analyses of your discussions.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. As I said about, my analyses of your interactions for this week included what you said in your comments/replies to one another. I think that this extension had shed really interesting light on these discussions and your degree of engagement.

2. ***Networks.*** One of the patterns that I discerned in reading through your Mattermost posts and replies has to do with the way your discussed (whether intentionally or not) and displayed **networks of interactions**. First, I will have more to say about this when I set up the work for Week 5, but for now I saw two things of note:

   * Your responses to the articles evolved from discussions about individuals to discussions about networks of actors. For example, @kieratucci posted this (which I will quote at length): *Looking at these articles and how the three ethical frameworks were used or questioned showed how difficult it is to know what is ethically “correct” or not. For one from the outside looking in and not knowing any of the information we learned you see that there is something greater whether it is a company, boss or organization that is trying to make life, jobs and work more efficient and less time consuming. However, this puts the workers and their job at risk because of how demanding that can be. Is that ethically correct? I explored how according to utilitarianism ethically it would be correct because while the workers lives are more miserable and their health is in jeopardy, the majority of the world and the rest of the population is benefiting so their is less consequence. On the other hand, according to virtue ethics, these technologies and they ways they are being used is not leading to virtuous and prosperous lives for the workers. It should be known and seen by the higher ups in the companies that this is taking a toll on the workers and is ethically wrong according the virtue ethics*. In this post, Kiera is talking very clearly about the networks occupied by workers (including their families) and corporations (their employees), and hints at ethical impact being a networked/social phenomenon. 

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive. This is a bit of a surprise since the main products for this week were the diagrams you created, which do not get figured into these analyses. I will need to look further, but this trend pertains to both your commentary on your diagrams as well as the comments you left for one another.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as for the last two weeks, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. What particularly stands out is the obvious focus of the terms *ethical* and *pm* in your discussions. *Ethical* makes complete sense as the focus for this week's discussion was on your creating a diagram representing our three primary ethical frameworks. *PM* is differently interesting in that it represents how frequently you are all doing this work at night. I only point it out because these type of data can talk about content as much as context. I was also interested to see the frequency of some other terms such as *companies*, *technology*, and *frameworks*.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=a4495bf8caef006f582d246c99d671da&query=ethical&query=frameworks&query=framework&query=articles&query=apply&query=using&query=ai&query=automation&query=use&query=transparency&query=people&query=technology&query=pm&query=hi&query=really&query=channel&query=great&query=enjoyed&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is especially interesting to me. This is the most extensive set of connections that we have seen so far. I believe this reflects the wider ranging commentary you created to discuss your diagrams AND the substantive comments/discussions you left for/had with one another. I invite you to dive more deeply for yourself into this visualization. What patterns do you see and why do you think they emerged?



Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 3 discussion on Mattermost.
