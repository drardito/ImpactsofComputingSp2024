I have finally got a chance to review your discussions around the texts/readings/viewings for Week 11. 

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. Your engagement and interaction with one another remains consistent, high, and substantive. See below for the trends in these discussions that I observed.

2. ***Impacts of AI on Criminal Justice***. I was very struck by how much these readings/viewings/listenings provoked thoughts and strong reactions.

*Overfall Shock and Surprise*. I thought this from @giannonem started us off really well:

> Something I personally found mind blowing, was from the beginning of the article Garbage In, Garbage Out. First off, observe the name, then consider what the garbage really is.  

 *Lack of Transparency*. Check out what @tamimit said here:
> Of course, the thought of such large databases existing, with people probably not knowing what is going on, is unsettling. And the potential for misuse by law enforcement is not exactly inspiring.

*Room for (Costly) Error*. Several of you talked about the very real consequences of error on the part of these AI systems. Check about what @andrewdiclerico has to say about data:

> The fact that facial recognition can allow police enforcement to identify a person of interest and potentially arrest them, though they may not be guilty, is concerning. Being a possible match does not automatically make you guilty, but it can put you in a group where it would be likely for you to be found guilty. Also, the NYPD having the ability to change a sketch to look more like a mugshot in order to get a more accurate match can cause issues because it is impossible to tell if they are guiding the AI in the wrong direction as they do not know exactly what the suspect looks like. 

And this from @christina_g:

> However, what was interesting to me was the fact that the police can use celebrity look alike to find a criminal or person of interest to arrest. There are a lot of people out there that can be paired with but it is an issue with the facial comparisons if the other celebrity didn't agree to that. However, in the podcast, the cameras can only detect the emotion but cannot make the inference on why a person is doing it. For example, if someone is smiling in a way that they did something bad, then it will predict what the reason was for it. Before this unit I didn't really pay attention to the facial recognition cameras because I didn't think anything of it.

*Needs for Constraints and Limits*. Thanks to @gabe for this:

> I do agree with you that it has taken policing to another level, but I fear that there being no constraints/limits to the implementation and possible forms of privacy invasiveness, would cause as much harm as it does good. We know that the system and the algorithms that runs it aren't perfect. That there are possibilities that inaccurate matches are generated by the image the data (sketches or photos) provided by the user. So to be using a system thats is still flawed at a massive scale, and to rely on it to incarcerate a criminal or exonerate a citizen, just doesn't sit all that well with me.



3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  After the slight downward tick a couple of weeks back, your writing has remained at the levels seen last week (and before 2 weeks ago). The overall word count from your Week 11 posts and replies (13,678 words), as well as your average words per sentence (21.4) and unique words (2,136) remain consistent with those values in former weeks.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as it always does, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. It is not surprising to see that the key terms in the texts show us in this visualization: *facial*, *recognition*, and *enforcement*. [Once again, our old friend *pm* has returned to prominence as well.] What is even more interesting to me is the diversity of the next frequency tier terms, such as: *technologyh*, *people*, *law*, *think*, and *use*. I would love to know what you make of this pattern.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=d497e67ec62133988970c1bdef7573ad&query=facial&query=recognition&query=systems&query=technology&query=enforcement&query=law&query=ai&query=tools&query=used&query=use&context=9&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting. I was particularly struck by the strength of an atypically small range of terms: *technology*, *facial*, *recognition*, *law*, and *enforcement.* I guess there is no surprise there, and this trends tracks well with your individual and collective responses to these terms and their implications (see above).
