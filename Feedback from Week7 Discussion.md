I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 6, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you wrestle with with Doctorow's ideas about platforms and enshittifcation.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. Once again, I appreciate the consistent ways in which you are engaging with one another, both in terms of frequency and substance. Keep up the good work!

2. ***Enshittification*** I really appreciated how you collectively responded to Doctorow's talk and reflection

*Making sense*. I thought this from @giannonem started us off really well:

> When I originally saw the word “enshittification” for the first time, I personally tried to pick the word apart and try to figure out how it related to the impacts of computing. When you see the word “enshittification” what's the first thing that comes to your mind? Without looking up the definition, what do you think the term means? Enshittification can be defined as how platforms decay due to the decreasing quality platforms provide to users’

Also, thanks to @tamimit who provided what I think is a great analogy:
> ,,,the three stages are like luring people with free cookies, charging for milk, and finally, breathing in their air at a high price.

 *Ethical Distance*. I appreciate what @nickisrael said here:
> I was immediately interested in the concept of “Ethical distance”. I interpreted it as the correlation between how close individuals are to something they might be blamed for. An individual's moral responsibility typically decreases as ethical distance increases. 

Also, thanks to @mtarby for this:
>I want to take a look at one part of Doctorow's proposed solution - specifically the self-help and regulation. I am reminded of the Week 4 reading on "Demon-haunted computers" where our devices physically will not let us self-regulate. In the same sense, companies have shown that they are unable to self-regulate. Therefore, there needs to be governmental regulations to bring us back from the current brink. Then, once we heal, perhaps the companies can have better internal oversight committees.

I thought @correial really hit home with this:
>  He explains how these platforms start great, however, they end up causing us issues in the end. These platforms used to be strictly about what and who we followed, now all of our data is being surveilled and these new ads and accounts can pop up on our feed at any time because our privacy is not being respected by this technology.

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive as represented by the total number of words, although slightly fewer than usual (13, 419 instead of the typical over 14,000). Despite this slight decrease in total words,  the number of unique words (over 2100), and average words per sentence (21.1) remain consistent. My guess is that centering around one text (the Doctorow speech) accounts for the slight dip in word count.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as for the past four weeks, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. My surmise about the explanation for a slightly lower word count than average is born out by this visualization, given the narrow set of frequently used terms: *companies*, *enshittification*, *platforms*, and *people*. For the first time in quite a while, the term *pm* is missing. Are you doing more postings between midnight and noon? I wonder.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=ac266bb9074e5f4816feba70c4cc585c&query=companies&query=longer&query=large&query=enshittification&query=workers&query=power&query=process&query=pm&query=idea&query=platforms&query=people&query=think&query=facebook&query=like&query=aware&query=started&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting to me. It is interesting to see the size and depth of the connections between the terms *enshittification*, *companies*, and *people*. What patterns do you see? And how do these trends reflect (or not) your experience of these texts this week?
