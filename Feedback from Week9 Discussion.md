I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 7, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you wrestle with algorithms and rabbit holes.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. Once again, I appreciate the consistent ways in which you are engaging with one another, both in terms of frequency and substance. Keep up the good work!

2. ***Algorithms*** I really appreciated how you engaged with these texts and how they talked about algorithms and rabbit holes.

*Making sense*. I thought this from @abramsons started us off really well:

> I came away not only thinking about how deep and complex algorithms and their systems are in society, but also the larger impact that they have had on computing, the way that people engage and interact with the Internet, and surveillance/privacy in an increasingly digital world.

 *Rabbit Holes*. I appreciate what @gabe_pollack said here:
> Algorithms are the steps that online platforms take to keep 'us' the public engaged with their product. Streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu, as well as YouTube all recommend stuff for their viewers to watch when they are done consuming something else, same with social media. I have found myself occasionally spiraling down rabbit holes of my own online, but I have always had the wherewithal to notice when I may have been sucked in, and to stop viewing when I do. 

Also, thanks to @mchughm1 for this:
>This week's reading, video, and podcast episodes gave me a lot to think about. I was aware of what an algorithm was but I didnâ€™t know just how common they were across my everyday life. Previously, when I thought of the word algorithm I pictured some complex computer programming. In reality, algorithms are simply replicable, step-by-step processes. Algorithms are present in almost every part of our day-to-day lives

I thought @eglentina.prozhmi really hit home with this:
>  Algorithms wield significant influence in our daily lives, shaping everything from the content we encounter online to the decisions made by automated systems. While they offer efficiency and convenience, concerns about algorithmic bias, accountability, and transparency persist. Algorithmic bias can perpetuate societal inequalities, posing ethical challenges that demand scrutiny and corrective action. 

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  For the second week in a row, the overall word count has once again declined (this week, to 12,580 words). However, your average words per sentence remains consistent. So, you are continuing to write as densely as you have been over the semester, while writing a bit less. I am not sure yet to what to attribute this downward trend, as well as whether this is a problem or not, so we will keep watching this to see what's what.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as it always does, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. It is not surprising to see that the key terms in the texts show us in this visualization: *algorithm/algorithms*, *youtube*, and *people*. This relatively narrow set of most frequently used terms may also indicate the second week of decline in overall word count (see above). It's hard to tell for sure, though. It is also interesting to see *pm* re-emerge. Perhaps, post-break you are back to your late night ways.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=75cf0db0460e32e65038f092401c2dfc&query=algorithms&query=social&query=youtube&query=used&query=media&query=people&query=internet&query=video&query=videos&query=algorithm&query=platforms&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting to me. In particular, I am struck by the narrower than usual range of highly linked terms. It is interesting to see the size and depth of the connections between the terms *algorithms/algorithm*, *social*, *platforms*, and *people*. What patterns do you see? And how do these trends reflect (or not) your experience of these texts this week?
