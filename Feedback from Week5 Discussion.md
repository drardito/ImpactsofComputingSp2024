I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 5, although I have been dropping in, so to speak, all week. It has been very interesting to see you wrestle with collective responsibility.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. As I said last week, my analyses of your interactions for this week included what you said in your comments/replies to one another. I think that this extension had shed really interesting light on these discussions and your degree of engagement.

2. ***Collective Responsibility.*** It was really interesting to see how much this concept resonated with so many of you. I can see some themes that emerged in relation to those discussions:

   * *Blame vs Responsibility*. I thought this from @gabepollack was really interesting

    > When it came to this weeks readings, I think I did a lot of mental gymnastics regarding the issues of individual vs collective morality. For me, when it comes to collective morality it is harder to assign blame to a collective than an individual. Can a corporation, or a group etc... really be blamed for moral harm? Where does individual responsibility end and collective responsibility begin? 

   * *Individuals as Consumers*. @tamimit made an interesting point about our identities in terms of these kinds of computing systems:

    > As a consumer, I am in my view impacted through targeted advertisements, however it is important to know that those advertisements are a result of a complicated network of statistics series, analysis, and advertising throughout various agencies and systems. I am simply one small a part of this larger system.

   * *Depth and Nuance*. I want to acknowledge @wallyd for the level of depth and nuance he brought to the discussion this week:

    > I guess I've been thinking and reading about collective moral responsibility for decades, so my previous posts already took it into account, except for one thing. The people that the companies are collecting data on are also part of "collectives". We are members of communities. In particular, we are members of the following communities: Manhattanville students, university students, people living in the northeast states, people living in the US, .... Are there collective actions we could take to change the way we are monitored and monetized? Doubtful. Probably the most effective thing we can do is to educate our family, friends, and students (for the School of Ed students) so that they can take actions to protect themselves. 

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive as represented by the total number of words (over 14,000, as usual) and the number of unique words (almost 2200), and average words per sentence (21.2, which has been very consistent, surprisingly). During the break, I will be looking at your discussions as a whole to see if any bigger, *collective* patterns emerge.

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud, as for the past four weeks, represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. This week, I am particularly struck by the wide range of the terms used in your discussions, especially: *collective*, *people*, *individuals*, *companies*, and *responsibility*. Oh, and once again, most of your are posting in the afternoons/evenings, as indicated by the frequency of the term *pm*. It would be very interesting to take a deeper dive into the ways in which you are using these terms.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=f247989c69f39f9d16f921ae54370b2c&query=collective&query=responsibility&query=moral&query=morality&query=lens&query=individual&query=blame&query=actions&query=harm&query=people&query=making&query=behind&query=obituaries&query=work&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) is very interesting to me. It is hardly surprising that the terms *collective* and *responsibility* are widely connected to many other terms, such as *moral*, *people*, and *obituaries*. One big surprise, was that the terms *corporations* and *companies* were connected to almost no other terms. What patterns do you see and why do you think they emerged?

Please feel free to share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 5 discussion on Mattermost.
