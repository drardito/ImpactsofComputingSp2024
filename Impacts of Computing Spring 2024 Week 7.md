The goal of this week is to explore apply the work that we have been doing in this unit so far on ***collective responsibility***, ***altruism***, and the moral and ethical effects of ***corporate actions***.


#### Here is the work for Week 7:

1. ***Introduction to Week 7*** - Please listen this to brief audio introduction to Week 7.

2. ***Readings/Listenings***

This week, we just have one text, which is a talk given at the end of January by Cory Doctorow, several of whose pieces we have read so far. Cory gave a prestigious talk recently, the  [Marshall McLuhan Lecture 2024](https://transmediale.de/en/2024/event/mcluhan-2024), which describes as being about what he calls *enshittification*: "Last year, I coined the term *enshittification*, to describe the way that platforms decay."

I am providing links to the video of the talk itself as well as Doctorow's commentary on his presentation. I strongly suggest watching/reading both:

* [Video of talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nycso_OQes0)
* [Doctorow's Reflection on Talk](https://pluralistic.net/2024/01/30/go-nuts-meine-kerle/#ich-bin-ein-bratapfel)

Please watch/read them from (at least) two perspectives:

- ***What does this talk have to do with the work of the course thus far? How does it related to the ethics and morality of computing and its impacts on our lives?***

- ***What would you like to know more about this topics/What questions do you have?/What do you agree and/or disagree with and why?***

As you listen to this talk, please continue take notes using the document and/or folder you created as a part of the work for previous weeks.  As I have said, the goal of these notes is to help you make sense of what you are reading and then having a reference to which you can refer as you apply these concepts. 

3. ***Interactions***

I continue to enjoy seeing the additional interactions from last week's posts as well as the posts for the current week's work. This pattern will continue this week as well. So, here is this week's ***interactions*** work:

- *Week 6 Replies*. Take a look at the posts you and your classmates made for Week 6 about ***moral taint*** and ***altruism** and leave replies/feedback/etc. for one another. Please do this by the **end of the day Wednesday**.
- *Week 7 Discussion*. Now that you have watched/listened to/read Cory's talk on enshittification, think about how they apply to our discussions and course work so far in this unit. Share your thoughts with us on Mattermost in the ***Week 7 channel***. Feel free to include screenshots in your post if you like. This is a great week for lots of discussion.

[Here is how you would upload images](https://docs.mattermost.com/collaborate/share-files-in-messages.html) to your Mattermost posts.

This work is due by the end of the day on ***Monday, March 11*** [right after break].
