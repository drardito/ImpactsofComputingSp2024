I have just finished reviewing the work you did in the discussion for Week 2, which (as I am sure you remember) asked you to analyze your own response to the ethical dilemma I posed in Week 1 through the lenses of the three ethical frameworks you read about.

Here is some feedback about your work in that discussion.

1. ***Engagement/Interaction***. I really appreciated the ways that you responded to one another when you did so. Thanks for that. But I also appreciate that this prompt favored an in-depth, solitary response. That being said, I am seeing a healthy degree of substantive responding, and only a little less so overall than last week. And as with last week (and which I completely understand), there were more responses to posts made earlier in the cycle. 

2. ***Substance.*** I was really impressed by how seriously you took this discussion prompt, and how thoughtful you were in your responses. What particularly struck me was how well your revealed your own thinking about how you approached the situation. For example, as Wendy said: *As I wrote in last week's response, I would wait for the individual to check out their million items first because TO ME that is the generous thing to do.  Patience is a way to demonstrate care for the other individual. Plus that person perhaps already even feels bad enough for holding up the line.* I saw of lot of this type of empathy and reflectiveness in many of your responses, which conveyed to me that you were really putting yourselves not just in your own *imaginary* shoes, but also those of the other person in the scenario. I look forward to seeing how your thinking along these lines evolves over the semester.

3. ***Visualizations.*** For this week, I once again used [Voyant Tools](https://voyant-tools.org/), which is designed to visualize various features of text. Here are some highlights of this analysis.

   1. *Features of your writing.*  Once again, your writing as a class was substantive This tells me that your writing was substantive (24 words per sentence, up from 21 last week), and relatively dense (vocab density). This means to me that you were writing at a consistently high level of quality. Well done!

   2. *Word Frequencies*. This word cloud represents the relative frequencies of the words you used in your posts. What particularly stands out is the obvious focus of virtue ethics as represented by the terms *virtue*, and *person* (mostly used in the sense of *good person*). We can see some usage of *utilitarianism* and *deontology*, but clearly you were collectively writing about yourselves via the framework of *virtue ethics*, which makes sense given the scenario.

   3. *Relationships Between Words.* [This visualization](https://voyant-tools.org/?corpus=e86e9c578eeec07e3069053a325c625b&query=person&query=line&query=making&query=ethical&query=ask&query=virtue&query=ethics&query=deontology&query=utilitarianism&query=week&query=emphasizes&mode=corpus&context=7&view=CollocatesGraph) reflects a similar trend. The term *virtue* is connected to far more words than either *utilitarianism* or *deontology*.  If you hover those two terms, you will see how they are connected to others. I wonder what you make of this.



Please share your thoughts about any/all of this in the Week 2 discussion on Mattermost.
